# Open-Credit-Score-Chain

The Open-Credit-Score-Chain (OCSC) is a proof of concept for an open and decentralized credit scoring system.
Users can see each entry of their credit score records and can choose what they want to share with whom.
The data to calculate the score from is stored encrypted on a blockchain, thus only the user can read the content.
If a company wants to know the credit score of a person, the person can provide a zero-knowledge proof of their score.
This way no unnecessary information is leaked, the user has full transparancy of their records and companies can nevertheless trust the scoring system.

## Concept

For a consistent and trusted record of entries 

### Why Ethereum?

### Credit Score DB Smart Contract
The main part of the application is the credit score db, which is implemented as a smart contract.
In this case it is an Ethereum smart contract but it can be migrated to other blockchains if necessary.
Every user that wants to be able
